# RemotePad

Crazy idea to draw over screen using any tablet or phone :-) of course on linux

Is a client-server application that allows users to use their tablet devices to draw over their computer screen. It is designed to enhance creativity and collaboration by providing an interactive drawing experience. This documentation will guide you through the installation, setup, and usage of the program.

WORK IN PROGRESS

### Features

- Two drawing modes: Mouse Drawing Mode (local) and Tablet Drawing Mode (remote)
- Tablet Drawing Mode accessible via a web interface, compatible with various tablet devices including iPads and Android tablets/phones.
- Screen capture and drawing capabilities on captured images.
- Supports image resizing for optimal tablet viewing.

#### Motivation

Learn X11, use my tablet, have fun

### Tips

#### Use in Visual Studio Code

Add a keyboard shortcut I am using CTRL+Shift+9, use preferences (Open Keyboard shortcuts (JSON)) to map the desired keys. DonÂ´t use the default

Sample

```
// Place your key bindings in this file to override the defaults
[{
    "key": "ctrl+shift+9",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence",
    "args": { "text": "~/dev_local/remotepad/remotepad.sh current\u000D" }
}
]
```
